I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Science.
I've taken a lot of programming courses and am very well versed in many languages.
I've held multiple technical internships and excelled at them--many of my projects are now in production.
Not only am I technically strong, I am a born leader and people naturally follow me because I'm very charismatic and a great listener.
I'm interested in this software position because I think I am a great cultural fit and have the technical skills required for this job.
Having gone to many Hackathons, I know that my skill set is advanced compared to other people with similar years of experience. 
I learn very quickly and it's benefitted not only me, but also my teammates and community.

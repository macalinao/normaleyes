What is your leadership style?
When there is a need for a leader, I always rise to the occasion.
People naturally look up to me because not only am I strong technically, but I am charismatic and a great listener.
When my teammates lack direction, I provide the inspiration and guidance they need.
I can always see the big picture but keep things in perspective.
